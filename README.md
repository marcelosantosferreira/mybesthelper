## Synopsis
A Mobile App built during a Hackathon (VanHackathon - https://www.vanhack.com/hackathon)

## Built using

Ionic Framework (with controllers and factories to manipulate any JSON Service)

## My Goal

Conceive a new flow in which the user get the quiz completed and a match sample before filling the personal data (name, email, phone and password).

On this way both Helpers and Families can get interested before receiving recomendations by email. 

## Tests (lab)

ionic serve --lab

Tip: in the ionic.project file it's set Firefox as Default Browser (change it or remove the line and the system default browser will be opened)
